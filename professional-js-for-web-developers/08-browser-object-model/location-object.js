// ‚óè THE LOCATION OBJECT
// One of the most useful BOM objects is location, which provides information about the document that is currently loaded in the window, 
// as well as general navigation functionality. The location object is unique in that it is a property of both window and document; 
// both window.location and document.location point to the same object.
