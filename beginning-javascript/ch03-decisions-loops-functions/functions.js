// Functions
// A function is something that performs a particular task. 
// Functions in JavaScript work a little like the function buttons on a pocket calculator: 
// They encapsulate a block of code that performs a certain task.
// The data that a function requires to be passed are known as its parameter(s).
// A function can have zero or more parameters, though even if it has no parameters, 
// you must still put the open and close parentheses after its name.
