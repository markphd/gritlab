Properties and methods of XMLHttpRequest

Purpose: Use this aid to obtain information on the properties and methods of the XMLHttpRequest object.

You use the XMLHttpRequest object in your Ajax applications to access data from the server. You can use one or more of its properties and methods to implement client/server communication. Some of the properties of the XMLHttpRequest object are the following:

    onreadystatechange - You use the onreadystatechange property to return or set the event handler for asynchronous usage of the XMLHttpRequest object.
    readyState - The status code of the readyState property – 0 through 4 – can be used to determine the state of the request operation.
    responseBody - Used only in IE 7 and returns the response as an array of unsigned bytes.
    responseText - If the HTTP response is a text string, you use the responseText property to return the response as a string.
    responseXML - When the HTTP response is an XML DOM object, you use the responseXML property to return the XML DOM object.
    status - With the status property, you can retrieve the status code that denotes the state of the HTTP request. The status code returned is a standard HTTP status code and can thus be used to determine the status of the HTTP request – for example, a status code of 404 denotes the page was not found.
    statusText - To obtain an easy-to-read status information about status of the HTTP request, you can use the statusText property.

The XMLHttpRequest object also has the following methods you can use during implementation of client/server communication:

    abort - You call the abort method to cancel the request that was sent.
    getAllResponseHeaders - To obtain the entire set of response headers, you use the getAllResponseHeaders method.
    getResponseHeader - If you need to retrieve a specific response header, you can use the getResponseHeader method.
    open - The open method is used to open the request. The method takes three arguments – the method attribute, the destination URL, and the asynchronous usage mode.
    send - The request is sent to the server by the send method.
    setRequestHeader - When you need to create custom HTTP response headers, you can use the setRequestHeader method.
